My portfolio

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS

## Functionalities
* On the portfolio home page, readers can see my previous work, links to sections, and how to contact me
* Then readers click one of the links in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
* My previous projects are shown with titled images.
* Images when hovered over can be larger in size than the others.
* A click on the images of the applications will takes the readers to that deployed application (except for plaerholders)
* When readers resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, they are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to their viewport
